# Controlled Randomness | Perlin Noise

Perlin Noise is a function which helps to generate random numbers that are a little bit closer.

The noise function typically has an array which contains random numbers at different positions,
but what is more interesting is that closer numbers in the array are not quite quantitatively different.

With the help of noise function, one can perform intricate tasks such as similating the movement of a snake as shown in this project.
